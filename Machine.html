	<h2>Machine Language</h2>
	<p>
	Regardless of what language you use, you eventually need to convert your program into machine language so that the computer can 
	understand it. There are two ways to do this:

				To transform a program written in a high-level programming language from source code into object code. Programmers write 
				programs in a form called source code. Source code must go through several steps before it becomes an executable program. The 
				first step is to pass the source code through a compiler, which translates the high-level language instructionsinto object code.
			</td>
			<td>
				An interpreter translates high-level instructions into an intermediate form, which it then executes.
				interpreters are sometimes used during the development of a program, when a programmer wants to add small sections 
				at a time and test them quickly.In addition, interpreters are often used in education because they allow students to program interactively.
