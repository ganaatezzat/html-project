	<p>
		High-level programming languages, while simple compared to human languages, are more complex than the languages the computer actually 
		understands, called machine languages. Each different type of CPU has its own unique machine language.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lying between machine languages and high-level languages are languages called assembly languages. Assembly languages are similar 
		to machine languages, but they are much easier to program in because they allow a programmer to substitute names for numbers. 
		Machine languages consist of numbers only.
