	<h2>What is a Programming Language?</h2>
	<p>
		A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. 
		The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.

		Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions.
